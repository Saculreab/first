<h1>Top 5 Crypto Faucets</h1>

<p>There are a handful of things that all of these faucets have in common, and it is the reason why they are my top 5 and really, the only faucets that I use and recommend. First, they are free. Anything you choose to put into the faucet, besides your time, is completely optional. Two, all but one have low minimums to withdraw, and can be directly withdrawn to your crypto wallet. Three, you can earn by doing the bare minimum, easiest of tasks, for example, hourly rolls, PTC (paid to click) ads, or surveys. Many of these faucets I simply do the hourly rolls and PTC ads, and they pay out small amounts directly to my personal wallet every two to eight weeks, depending on my effort and luck. Four, all of these faucets have been around for a number of years now, and have a strong following and dedicated community that both contribute and partake.</p>

<p>
You won’t get rich with faucets.  At best, you will take the sting out of trading fees, or be able to stake rewards to keep your faucet earnings multiplying.  With referrals, you can increase your earnings greatly as well.  So even though you may not get rich, they are still  worth the little bit of time you put in.  
</p>

<p>
It takes less than a few minutes to run through the hourlies on these faucets, so it really is a small investment of time with a huge historical earnings potential.  Instead of mindlessly scrolling social media, you can monetize that spare time through these faucets.  If you want to earn even more, you always have the choice to put more time in to do so.
</p>

<p>
Following are descriptions of the top faucets, in addition to my experience with them, followed by an ad banner which contains my referral link to the faucet.  Thanks for your attention, and happy collecting!

<h2>1. Cointiply</h2>

<p>With Cointiply, I do at least 8 of the hourly draws a day, and go through the PTC ads at that time as well. Just doing that I earn about $5 USD in BTC every three weeks. In addition, there is a leveling system so your earnings increase overtime. There is also the option to do surveys to earn additional crypto, and other offers. However, these other offers aren’t as reliable or immediate as the hourly draws and PTC ads. Minimum amount to withdraw is 50,000 cointiply points, which is roughly $5 USD. Cointiply pays 5% interest on coin balances over 35,000 cointiply points. I have withdrawn directly both to an exchange and a personal wallet. You can withdraw BTC, Doge, LTC, and DASH. This was my top earner for a long time, before I leveled up some of the other faucets on this list. Please click on the banner below for the Cointiply experience!</p>

<h2>2. Faucetcrypto</h2>

<p>A close second for personal historical earnings is faucetcrypto.  It’s very much like Cointiply with similar earning opportunities.  9 coins on this faucet equals 1 satoshi, with a minimum withdraw amount (in BTC) of 8,000 coins or just under 900 satoshi.  At my current level, I earn 22 coins a draw, plus more with PTC ads, and do a minimum withdraw every two weeks.  Faucetcrypto offers 22 cryptocurrencies to withdraw from, and I have withdrawn to both my personal wallet and to an exchange.  Faucetcrypto has successfully gamified the faucet experience, with a level system and item drops to boost your earnings.  Click the banner below and level up your crypto with Faucetcrypto!</p>

<h2>3. Freebitcoin</h2>

<p>I hesitated to include freebitcoin on this list, as the minimum withdraw is pretty high compared to the faucet pull amount.  Yet, I think this is perhaps one of the most enjoyable faucets on this list, as it is essentially a betting site, with huge earning potentials.  I won $50 USD on one roll for example.  Included with this faucet is an hourly roll, sports betting, hi/lo dice game, and a daily spin the wheel challenge.  Click the banner below and come join the fun at freebitcoin!</p>

<h2>4. Publish0x</h2>

<p>Publish0x is a unique blogging site, in which bloggers will post articles, and there is an option to tip.  The tips come from the community pool, so users do not contribute any crypto, and you get a portion of the tip.  For example, if you tip 75% out of 100%, you will get 25%.  And again, tips come from the community pool.  Some of the posts are really good and informative, so this is a blog site to check out.  Crypto is paid in Optimism or Eth, over the Optimism network, with a minimum withdraw amount of $.50 USD.  I withdraw the minimum about once a month, with the ability to tip a maximum of six articles a day.  There is more earning potential if you become a contributor, as then others will be tipping you through your posts.

<h2>5. Rollercoin</h2>

<p>Rollercoin is my current favorite as far as faucets go.  Essentially, there are events that run from 60 to 90 days, and you perform tasks like taking surveys or playing mini-games to level up through the event.  The minimum withdraw amount is .001 satoshi, which I withdraw every 10 to 14 days.  There are 13 cryptocurrencies to withdraw from, including Sol, BNB, and Matic.  Some tips for earning on Rollercoin are; 1. Focus more on your mining bonus percent rather than the mining power, and 2. Mine crypto and earn the site token through event rewards, Rollercoin marketplace, and surveys.  Click the banner below to play at crypto and earn big with Rollercoin!</p>
